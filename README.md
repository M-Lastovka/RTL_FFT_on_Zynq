# RTL_FFT_on_Zynq

reworking of old RTL FFT (VHDL) project of mine with aim of integrating in on a Zynq SoC

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This projects integrates my custom FFT core within the Zynq SoC, using DMA. My VHDL FFT core is embedded within a SystemVerilog top, together with
SystemVerilog AXI stream interfaces (master and slave). I decided to remove some of the design that was done in RTL and move it to SW for more run-time
flexibility.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The used board is the TUL PYNQ Z2 board. The data are saved in the DDRAM by the Zynq PS. PS implements data windowing and zero-padding (previously done)
in PL. Interfacing PS-PL is done with simple single channel DMA. FFT is fixed point, resolution is reconfigurable. The FFT is a classic Cooley-Tukey
Radix2 implementation with decimation in frequency. The twiddle factors are stored in a ROM in PL, the VHDL file for the ROM is generated by a matlab script.
